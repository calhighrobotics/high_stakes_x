 *
 * The Drivetrain class is responsible for controlling the movement of the
 * robot's drivetrain. It provides functions to interpret joystick inputs and
 * convert them into appropriate drivetrain movements. The drivetrain can be
 * controlled using different drive modes, such as tank drive or arcade drive.
 *
 * The Drivetrain class also allows setting and retrieving the dead zone value
 * for the joystick. The dead zone is a range around the joystick's resting
 * position where no movement is registered. By adjusting the dead zone value,
 * the sensitivity of the joystick inputs can be fine-tuned.
