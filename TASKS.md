# TO-DO

## Ideas
- Implement testing for the codebase
- Create 4 Bar class and controller when idea is finalized
- Be able to control the color sensor in the intake class, maybe a toggle system for the sensor, integrated with the disabled screen.
- PID's for lifts / Ramp up subsystems

## To Complete
- Re-enable IMU calibration at entrypoint
- Check whether manual drive mode changes work with toggle func & comp. switch
- Driving information on screen
    - Deprecate Utility class as soon as live driving data can be displayed with LVGL
- Tune autonomous routine - Specifically Pure pursuit

## In Progress
- Update 1516B wiki to latest codebase.
    - Write lvgl article
- Autonomous selector screen -> Check final bugs and UI prefs, then will be completed.

## Completed
- Implemented basic toggle systems for switching subsystems during robot usage & disabled mode.
