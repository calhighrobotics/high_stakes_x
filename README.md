# 1516X - High Stakes

This is the [High Stakes repository](https://github.com/calhighrobotics/high_stakes_x) for team **1516X**

We are a VEX VRC team based in the Bay Area, California.

We have both a wiki that covers high-level programming, engineering, design, and team management topics, as well as Doxygen documentation for our codebase.

- [Wiki](https://calhighrobotics.github.io/1516x)
- [Doxygen Documentation](https://calhighrobotics.github.io/high_stakes_x)

We aim to have a cohesive codebase that covers many subsystems but also follows best practices in the C++ development space as well as bringing in new features through modularity.

The codebase is split up into:

```text
/include - Contains information about the declarations of various methods and how they would be used
   /robot - Contains the header files and information custom for the actual robot.
/src - Contains implementation of the above methods and the definition, specific to the 1516X robot
```

## Other Libraries

We use the following libraries to make our codebase possible. Check out their code for types and functions that we use as well.

- [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/pros-4/)
- [Lemlib](https://lemlib.readthedocs.io/)
- [lvgl](https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/)
